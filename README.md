# Portfolio

WFM Administrator who has taken an interest in the tech field and have recently completed a Data Science Certification with HyperionDev. As a result of taking the course with HyperionDev, I have since developed skills in Python, R, SQL and beginner level Java. My experience from Financial Accounting brings with it analytical, problem solving and reporting skills that have had a direct impact on executive level decision making.

I have worked as WFM Administrator for The Foschini Group, worked as aTeam Leader in Sales for The Foschini Group and also worked as a Collections Agent.

I am passionate about Tech. The world seems to be moving in a more technologically advance direction and I am always one to make the necessary changes to keep up with the times. I would like to combine my experience in RTA with my new found skill as a junior data scientist and hopefully end up as a business analyst. I am particularly excited by the business industry use of machine learning and AI algorithms in everyday use and would like to sow my seeds in this new but ever growing field.
